# nodding_game

This Game is a fun game to challenge you and your friends. It is build for the eSense Earables, but you can also play it without them.

In this cool nodding game you can callenge your reaction speed. When you start the game, you will see an arrow pointing in on of four directions randomly. 

If you play without the headphones, use the arrows on the bottom to click the matching arrow to collect points. 

When playing with your headphones, move your head in the right direction as the arrow shows you. Notice that to move left or right you have to lay down your head on the shoulder, because the game reacts to the gyro sensor data of the headphones and not the accelerometer. You also have to be fast enough with your head movement. It only reacts if you are fast enough.
